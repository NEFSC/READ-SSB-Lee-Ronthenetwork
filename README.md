# Running R on one of the network servers using putty!

This is adapted from Liz Brooks's powerpoint documentation, in which she has collected wisdom from David Hiltz

# Part 1 - Download and Install Putty
You need to have a way to connect to the NEFSC servers. For windows users, PuTTY is a good choice.  [Here's your download link](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).  Chances are you want the 64 bit windows installer. 

# Part 2 - Optional WinSCP
While you are installing things, you might want to get [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php). This lets you transfer files to a server easily. Of course, you can use the file manager built into windows or do it from the command line. 

# Part 3 - Connect to the One of the Unix Servers and log in.

# Part 4 - Use Screen
